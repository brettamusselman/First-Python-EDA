# First-Python-EDA
Author: Brett Musselman
Purpose: Attempt an EDA using various libraries like PANDAS, matplotlib, and seaborn to analyze and visualize large data set
Dataset Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package
I used various github pages and syntax pages to understand what the commands did, but I mainly followed: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2020/08/exploratory-data-analysiseda-from-scratch-in-python/ in an attempt to replicate the visualizations from this study: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-95735-8.
